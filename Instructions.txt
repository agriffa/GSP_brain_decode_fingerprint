First part of the code (task decoding with structure-function coupling or functional data): 


- run the script GSP_brain_decode_fingerprint/Code/task_decoding_FullPipeline.m

- allows to perform SVM task classifications for task decoding, with the choice on SDI, FC nodal strength, c-FC, d-FC, or FC values.

- takes data directly from the folder Data



Second part of the code (individual fingerprinting with structure-function coupling or functional data): 


- run the script GSP_brain_decode_fingerprint/Code/individual_fingerprinting_FullPipeline.m

- allows to perform SVM subject classifications for individual fingerprinting, with the choice on SDI, FC nodal strength, c-FC, d-FC, or FC values.

- takes data directly from the folder Data



Third part of the code (PLSC relating brain measures and cognitive scores):


- this part requires the PLS implementation developed at the MIP:Lab - EPFL ( https://github.com/danizoeller/myPLS ). Download the myPLS code from the GitHub repository and copy the downloaded folder 'myPLS-master' to Code_For_Publication/PLS_SDI

- run the script GSP_brain_decode_fingerprint/Code/PLSC_FullPipeline.m  

- allows to perform PLSC analysis for SDI, FC nodal strength, c-FC, d-FC, or FC values and 10 cognitive scores, with the choice on functional values from one of the 8 tasks (resting-state and 7 tasks)

- takes data directly from the folder Data
